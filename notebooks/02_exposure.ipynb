    "# 02 - Build Non-ICU RAAS Early Exposure Tables\n",
    "## 0. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook constructs early renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor exposure variables for adult, non-ICU hospital admissions using the MIMIC-IV database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using SQL-based preprocessing in BigQuery, inpatient medication prescription records are linked to hospital admission timestamps to identify early-in-admission RAAS inhibitor exposure, defined as at least one prescription for an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with a documented start time occurring on or after hospital admission and within the first 24 hours of admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting exposure indicators are constructed at the hospital admission (`hadm_id`) level and materialized as BigQuery tables for use in downstream cohort description and outcome analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to define and construct early RAAS inhibitor exposure variables at the hospital admission level for adult, non-ICU admissions in MIMIC-IV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook:\n",
    "- Defines early RAAS inhibitor exposure using inpatient prescription records from the MIMIC-IV prescriptions table\n",
    "- Restricts exposure ascertainment to prescriptions with start times occurring within 24 hours after hospital admission, prior to outcome occurrence, to preserve temporal ordering\n",
    "- Constructs admission-level binary indicators for:\n",
    "  - ACE inhibitor exposure\n",
    "  - ARB exposure\n",
    "  - Combined ACE inhibitor and ARB exposure\n",
    "  - Any RAAS inhibitor exposure\n",
    "- Materializes these exposure variables as reproducible BigQuery tables for downstream baseline characterization and outcome modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses exclusively on exposure variable construction and does not perform descriptive analyses, statistical modeling, or outcome evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
